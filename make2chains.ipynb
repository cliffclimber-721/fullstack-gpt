      "- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\n",
      "- 2 tbsp tomato paste\n",
      "- 1 tbsp garam masala\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground cumin\n",

      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "- Cooked rice or naan bread (to serve)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

Enjoy your delicious Chicken Tikka Masala!As a vegetarian chef, I can help you make a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala by replacing the chicken with a suitable alternative. Here's how you can modify the recipe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb firm tofu, pressed and cut into bite-sized pieces (to replace the chicken)\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt (you can use plant-based yogurt made from soy or coconut milk)\n",
      "- 2 tbsp lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\n",
      "- 2 tbsp tomato paste\n",
      "- 1 tbsp garam masala\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground cumin\n",
      "- 1 tsp ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 tsp turmeric\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "- Cooked rice or naan bread (to serve)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Follow the same marinating process as in the original recipe, but substitute the chicken with tofu. Tofu can absorb flavors well, so marinate it for at least 1 hour or overnight for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Instead of baking the chicken skewers, you can pan-fry or bake the marinated tofu until it is golden and slightly crispy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Proceed with the recipe as directed, replacing the chicken with the cooked tofu pieces when adding them to the skillet with the tomato sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Allow the tofu to simmer in the sauce for a few minutes to absorb the flavors and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Serve the Vegetarian Tikka Masala over rice or with naan bread, garnished with fresh cilantro.\n",
